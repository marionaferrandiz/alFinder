1) Download ALL documents from https://github.com/tbigot/alFinder and save them in the same folder (e.g. NGS_analysis)
2) Try the demo first in the DEMO folder of the previously created folder (e.g. NGS_analysis) 
   a) In the DEMO folder the user can find an example based on the method described in the following article: 
   Large-scale genotyping by next generation sequencing: how to overcome the challenges to reliably genotype individuals?
   Ferrandiz-Rovira M, Bigot T, Allainé D, Callait-Cardinal M-P, Radwan J, Cohas A.
   	the file "data.fna" contains the output data from the sequencing machine
   	the file "tags.csv" contains the tags
   	the files "alleles_locus1.fas", "alleles_locus2.fas", "alleles_locus3.fas" and "alleles_locus4.fas" contain the previously described alleles for four loci
   	the file "correspondenceData.csv" contains the correspondence file
   	the "output_demo" folder contains outputs from the DEMO settings  
  	the file “settings.ini” is modified according to the method described in the article and is ready to be use
   	the file “postprocessing.py” is modified according to the method described in the article and is ready to be use
   b) Open the terminal (if python is not installed in your computer please download and install it on https://www.python.org/)
   c) Use the command "cd" or "C:" depending on the operating system of your computer (linux/mac and Windows) to go in the directory where ALL downloaded documents have been saved (e.g. cd /home/NGS_analysis/DEMO)
   d) Call “alFinder.py” file in the terminal (type "python alFinder.py" in the terminal)
   e) Call “postprocessing.py” file in the terminal (type "python postprocessing.py" in the terminal)
   f) Close the terminal
   g) You can find the results in the previously created folder (e.g. NGS_analysis/DEMO)
   	the file "data_result.csv" is the obtained result after typing "python alFinder.py" in the terminal
   	the file "data_filteredResults.csv" is the obtained result after typing "python postprocessing.py" in the terminal

3) You run succesfully the demo, now try it on your own data
   a) Put your own data in the previously created folder (e.g. NGS_analysis):
	a file with the output data from the sequencing machine
   	a file with the tags
   	a file/files with the previously described alleles (if no previously described alleles: an empty file should be present for each locus)
   	if necessary: the correspondence file
   b) Modify “settings.ini” according to your needs, save and close it (see example in the "settings.ini" of the DEMO folder)
   c) Modifiy “postprocessing.py” according to your needs, save and close it (see example in the “postprocessing.py” of the DEMO folder)
   d) Open the terminal
   e) Use the command "cd" or "C:" depending on the operating system of your computer (linux/mac and Windows) to go in the directory where ALL downloaded documents have been saved (e.g. cd /home/NGS_analysis)
   f) Call “alFinder.py” file in the terminal (type "python alFinder.py" in the terminal)
   g) Call “postprocessing.py” file in the terminal (type "python postprocessing.py" in the terminal)
   h) You can find the results in the previously created folder (e.g. NGS_analysis)
