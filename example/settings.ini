[Files.Alleles]

# Alleles
# =======
# List of N files, N being the number of loci
# VERY IMPORTANT:
#    1/ loci should be in the same order in the tags and allele files: e.g. if column 2 and 3 of the tags file contain tags of locus 1, 0= alleles_locus1.fas
#    2/ there must be as many fasta sequences as described alleles
#    3/ if no described alleles: an empty file should be present
